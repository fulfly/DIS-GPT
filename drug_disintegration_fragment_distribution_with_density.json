        "description": "Describe how fragments are generated and their spatial distribution.",
        "example": "Initially, large fragments remain near the tablet's original position, but smaller particles progressively disperse throughout the medium."

        "description": "Detail how fragment density evolves over time.",
        "example": "The majority of fragments are initially concentrated near the disintegration site, but gradually disperse, decreasing local density."

        "description": "Describe how fragments move and settle in the dissolution medium.",
        "example": "Larger fragments sink to the bottom, while finer particles remain suspended, creating a cloud-like turbidity."

        "description": "Use temporal markers to track changes in fragment distribution.",
        "example": "At 1 minute, larger fragments have settled at the bottom, while the finer particles are evenly suspended."
