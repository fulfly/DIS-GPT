      "surface_smoothness_and_roughness": {
        "description": "Document how the surface becomes rougher as disintegration progresses.",
        "example": "Initially smooth, the tablet surface gradually roughens, with tiny pores and cracks forming over time."

      "formation_of_fibrous_structures": {
        "description": "Describe how fibrous or flaky structures emerge.",
        "example": "The surface fibers emerge along the cracks, creating a network of fibrous structures as the disintegration continues."

        "description": "Detail the formation of pores on the surface, and how they expand.",
        "example": "Small pores form initially and continue to expand, eventually contributing to the crumbling of the tablet structure."

        "description": "Note the progression of cracks and any peeling effect.",
        "example": "The surface begins to peel off, forming flakes, while deep cracks widen over time."
