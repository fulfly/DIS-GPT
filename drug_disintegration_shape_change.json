        "description": "Describe how the drug shape changes from intact to fragmented.",
        "example": "The initially cylindrical tablet begins to break apart into smaller, irregularly shaped pieces, eventually forming multiple fragments."

      "surface_structure_changes": {
        "description": "Note changes in the surface, such as the appearance of cracks or roughness.",
        "example": "The surface changes from smooth to rough as cracks and pores begin to form across the surface."

      "volume_and_contour_changes": {
        "description": "Explain how the volume and contour of the tablet evolve during the disintegration.",
        "example": "The tablet's volume significantly reduces, and its contours become less defined as disintegration proceeds."

        "description": "Incorporate specific time markers to illustrate the transformation.",
        "example": "In the initial 30 seconds, the tablet remains largely intact, but at 1 minute, visible cracks appear, and the volume starts to decrease."
