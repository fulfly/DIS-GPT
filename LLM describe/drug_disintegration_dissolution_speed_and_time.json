    "overview": "This dimension focuses on capturing the dynamic changes in the dissolution rate over time, emphasizing variations due to particle size and liquid penetration.",
    "aspects": {
      "dynamic_changes_in_dissolution_rate": {
        "description": "Describe changes in dissolution rate across different stages.",
        "example": "The dissolution rate is slow initially, increasing rapidly as the tablet breaks apart and more surface area becomes available."
      },
      "particle_formation_and_impact_on_dissolution": {
        "description": "Explain how the creation of smaller particles affects dissolution speed.",
        "example": "As larger fragments disintegrate into finer particles, the overall dissolution rate increases due to greater surface exposure."
      },
      "effect_of_liquid_penetration": {
        "description": "Describe how liquid absorption impacts dissolution speed.",
        "example": "Upon complete penetration of liquid into the core, the dissolution rate spikes, resulting in rapid fragmentation."
      },
      "time_sequence_descriptions": {
        "description": "Use timestamps to mark significant dissolution rate changes.",
        "example": "The dissolution rate peaks at 2 minutes, following rapid internal disintegration."
